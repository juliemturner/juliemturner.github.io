## Getting Stared with hTWOo-React presentation

>This PnP Community demo is taken from the Viva Connections & SharePoint Framework Bi-weekly sync call recorded on January 12, 2023.

I recently had the opportunity to present a "Getting Started with hTWOo React" session on the bi-weekly Viva Connections & SharePoint Framework call. I always love being able to present the fun stuff I'm working on to the rest of the community. For those of you who are not familiar, hTWOo is an open source alternative for Microsoftâ€™s Fluent UI Web Design system. Although we currently provide a component library for only the ReactJS framework (hTWOo React), this project also offers a style guide based on HTML and CSS (hTWOo Core) to allow users to create implementations for any other frameworks. What's especially great for those of us who develop solution that extend Microsoft 365 is that Microsoft's Fluent UI ReactJs components are particularly opinionated about how you use them and because the library is ever evolving and not backwards compatible with previous versions, like Office UI Fabric React, you end up having to do a lot of rework to stay up to date. We believe that our open source version of hTWOo React provides a better development experience with accessibility and extensibility as a top priority.

We would love for you to give hTWOo React or hTWOo Core a try and [give us feedback](https://github.com/n8design/htwoo) about your experience. And check out the video above, where I walk you through getting started with hTWOo React in the SharePoint Framework (SPFx). You can also use hTWOo in any [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) project, we support ReactJS versions 16.x -> 18.2. If you'd rather have your getting started as documentation, you can get that by seeing our full [Storybook documentation](https://lab.n8d.studio/htwoo/htwoo-react/?path=/story/introduction-getting-started--page).

Happy Coding!
