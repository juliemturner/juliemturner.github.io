To support my colleague [Bob German](https://blogs.msdn.com/b/bobgerman/ "Bob German") and his great talk on Future Proofing your [SharePoint](https://sharepoint.microsoft.com "Microsoft SharePoint") solutions I helped him by building a SharePoint charting dashboard that used client side scripting libraries to pull data from a SharePoint list and display it using commercially available client side charting library.  He has asked me to share those solutions and so finally here they are.  I really appreciate all of Bob's great feedback and hope these examples can help people out there get started on building their own dashboards.
