![Microsoft MVP](MVP_Logo.png)
Yesterday was a huge day for me professionally as I was awarded my first (and hopefully not last) [Microsoft MVP Award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/). It was such a huge honor, and I felt it appropriate to give a shout out here to the Microsoft community for their support. There have been so many great mentors in my life over the years, many of whom I still collaborate with on a regular (if not daily) basis. Everyone that I interact with has been so supportive in helping me find my way whether it be technically or “socially”, and I hope I have often been able to reciprocate in kind. So, thank you to everyone I interact with in the community for being so open and generous with your knowledge and time! It's been a whirlwind year for me, as the date of March 1, also marks a year since I first started talking to [Marc](http://sympmarc.com/) about the possibility of joining him at [Sympraxis Consulting](http://sympraxisconsulting.com). What felt like a huge decision was probably the best one I've ever made. He's been a great mentor as I embarked on taking what I always did quietly behind the scenes out into the community. This last year has seen me do things many who’ve known me were somewhat shocked by… helping organize the [Granite State SharePoint User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Granite-State-SharePoint-Users-Group/events/235672573/), blogging more, speaking at conferences (this was the big one), and then connecting with various colleagues of Marc's (and now of mine), in the MVP community. So, also, a special thank you to him, as I absolutely couldn't have done it without him. I hope this marks only the beginning of this new-ish phase of my professional life, thanks again!
