## Podcasts/Video Shows

[CloudDev Clarity]https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWv_zMQc_6MpWuYXVEybqj_iGzKlsqGbo)

This show is where Andrew Connell & Julie Turner can discuss, debate, and even disagree on topics specific to developers who are primarily working in the Microsoft cloud space. That includes Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365, but it's not limited to those areas! They'll also cover topics related to these areas, like testing tools, development tools, practices, and anything else.

[Browser Native](https://officedev.github.io/browser-native/)

In the Browser Native series, co-hosts Julie Turner & Bob German explore features built into all modern browsers that you might have missed if you’ve been working within a particular framework or library. Each episode includes one or more samples where you can see the code and watch it run, so it’s easy to follow along. Please join us as we level up our skills together and learn about powerful capabilities that are browser native!
