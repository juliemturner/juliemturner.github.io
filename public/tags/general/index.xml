      <description>Yesterday was a huge day for me professionally as I was awarded my first (and hopefully not last) Microsoft MVP Award. It was such a huge honor, and I felt it appropriate to give a shout out here to the Microsoft community for their support. There have been so many great mentors in my life over the years, many of whom I still collaborate with on a regular (if not daily) basis.</description>

      <description>I recently attended a multi-day event at the Microsoft campus in Redmond, WA. Early in the morning and blurry-eyed from battling the time change, I found my way into the event room to see Marc D. Anderson in an aisle seat plugging away at his computer with a mouthwatering bacon covered donut sitting daintily on a paper napkin at his elbow… that, my friends, is a conversation starter!
Sometimes in life, things are just obvious really quickly.</description>
